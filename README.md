# NexusSocial Identity Repo

This serves as a monorepo for projects related to accounts and identity.

In particular, it hosts:
* [did-key](did-key) - Decentralized Identifiers that are "just a public key".
* [did-pkarr](did-pkarr) - PKARR based Decentralized Identifiers.
* [identity-server](/identity-server) - A did:web HTTP server that implements a "sign
  in with google/meta" approach.

Docs for the repo live [in the mdbook](https://nexussocial.github.io/identity/).
